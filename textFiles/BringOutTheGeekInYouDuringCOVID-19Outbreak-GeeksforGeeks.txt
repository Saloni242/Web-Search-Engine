We hope that you all are taking the proper precautions mentioned by the health organizations to stay safe and to protect yourself from this serious infectious disease. Most of the people are staying at home during this time and avoiding going outside. Schools and colleges are also closed. A lot of people are unable to continue their studies and learning because they can’t go outside, they can’t attend the classroom programs, they can’t interact with friends or mentors to get the help and they can’t attend any meetups or events as well. So you might be thinking to spend this free time doing some below stuff… Watching a new TV series on Netflix or Amazon Prime Searching for a new game and get really into it. Spending your whole day roaming in your house, sleeping, eating, scrolling social media, listening music and staring out the window at the empty streets around you. Before you think to do any of the things mentioned above remember that a wise person always remains calm in these kinds of situations and will try to consume enough of the knowledge so that he/she can become a valuable asset later. If you feel that you are stuck at home and you can’t continue your studies without attending your college and interacting with your mentor and friends then here is a quick motivation and an interesting fact for you… When the Great Plague of London was going around in 1665, Cambridge University shut down and Issac Newton was forced to stay home. During this time, he invented calculus, parts of optic theory and allegedly, while sitting in his garden, he saw an apple fall from a tree that inspired his understanding of gravity and laws of motion. So, if you think you are can’t achieve anything while staying at home then you are wrong. You are not powerless and your brain is not different than Newton or Einstein or any other legend. Technology can save someone’s life, you can utilize this time wisely, you can develop your technical skills and you can build some applications to help others. You can also utilize this time to develop your coding skills and secure a job in the future for yourself. Now the question is how, if you can’t go outside…?? To build an application and to secure a job, a lot of people (including self-taught) teach programming to themselves using the free online resources and this is something you can do at this time… Practice the Coding Problems and Uplift Your Skills Data structure and Algorithms is the most important skill to become a good programmer or to crack the interview of any top tech product-based companies.

Benefits of Automated Cross-Browser Testing for Online Business Comparing Python with C and C++ Brain Machine Interface (BMI) Bring Out The Geek In You During COVID-19 Outbreak The world is facing one of the worst epidemics, the outbreak of COVID-19, you all are aware of that and this is not the first time when we are fighting against some pandemic. We hope that you all are taking the proper precautions mentioned by the health organizations to stay safe and to protect yourself from this serious infectious disease. Most of the people are staying at home during this time and avoiding going outside. Schools and colleges are also closed. A lot of people are unable to continue their studies and learning because they can’t go outside, they can’t attend the classroom programs, they can’t interact with friends or mentors to get the help and they can’t attend any meetups or events as well. So you might be thinking to spend this free time doing some below stuff… Watching a new TV series on Netflix or Amazon Prime Searching for a new game and get really into it. Spending your whole day roaming in your house, sleeping, eating, scrolling social media, listening music and staring out the window at the empty streets around you. Before you think to do any of the things mentioned above remember that a wise person always remains calm in these kinds of situations and will try to consume enough of the knowledge so that he/she can become a valuable asset later. If you feel that you are stuck at home and you can’t continue your studies without attending your college and interacting with your mentor and friends then here is a quick motivation and an interesting fact for you… When the Great Plague of London was going around in 1665, Cambridge University shut down and Issac Newton was forced to stay home. During this time, he invented calculus, parts of optic theory and allegedly, while sitting in his garden, he saw an apple fall from a tree that inspired his understanding of gravity and laws of motion. So, if you think you are can’t achieve anything while staying at home then you are wrong. You are not powerless and your brain is not different than Newton or Einstein or any other legend. Technology can save someone’s life, you can utilize this time wisely, you can develop your technical skills and you can build some applications to help others. You can also utilize this time to develop your coding skills and secure a job in the future for yourself. Now the question is how, if you can’t go outside…?? To build an application and to secure a job, a lot of people (including self-taught) teach programming to themselves using the free online resources and this is something you can do at this time… Practice the Coding Problems and Uplift Your Skills Data structure and Algorithms is the most important skill to become a good programmer or to crack the interview of any top tech product-based companies.

We hope that you all are taking the proper precautions mentioned by the health organizations to stay safe and to protect yourself from this serious infectious disease. Most of the people are staying at home during this time and avoiding going outside. Schools and colleges are also closed. A lot of people are unable to continue their studies and learning because they can’t go outside, they can’t attend the classroom programs, they can’t interact with friends or mentors to get the help and they can’t attend any meetups or events as well. So you might be thinking to spend this free time doing some below stuff… Watching a new TV series on Netflix or Amazon Prime Searching for a new game and get really into it. Spending your whole day roaming in your house, sleeping, eating, scrolling social media, listening music and staring out the window at the empty streets around you. Before you think to do any of the things mentioned above remember that a wise person always remains calm in these kinds of situations and will try to consume enough of the knowledge so that he/she can become a valuable asset later. If you feel that you are stuck at home and you can’t continue your studies without attending your college and interacting with your mentor and friends then here is a quick motivation and an interesting fact for you… When the Great Plague of London was going around in 1665, Cambridge University shut down and Issac Newton was forced to stay home. During this time, he invented calculus, parts of optic theory and allegedly, while sitting in his garden, he saw an apple fall from a tree that inspired his understanding of gravity and laws of motion. So, if you think you are can’t achieve anything while staying at home then you are wrong. You are not powerless and your brain is not different than Newton or Einstein or any other legend.
