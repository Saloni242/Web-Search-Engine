Pseudo-polynomial Algorithms NP-Completeness | Set 1 (Introduction) A Time Complexity Question Time Complexity of building a heap Applications of Heap Data Structure Why is Binary Heap Preferred over BST for Priority Queue? Binomial Heap Fibonacci Heap | Set 1 (Introduction) Minimum increment or decrement operations required to make the array sorted Minimize the cost of partitioning an array into K groups Count total number of even sum sequences Sum of numbers in a range [L, R] whose count of divisors is prime Find next greater element with no consecutive 1 in it's binary representation Random list of M non-negative integers whose sum is N A Time Complexity Question What is the time complexity of following function fun()? Assume that log(x) returns log value in base 2. filter_none edit close play_arrow link brightness_4 code void fun() { int i, j; for (i=1; i<=n; i++) for (j=1; j<=log(i); j++) printf("GeeksforGeeks"); } chevron_right filter_none Time Complexity of the above function can be written as Θ(log 1) + Θ(log 2) + Θ(log 3) + . . . . + Θ(log n) which is Θ (log n!) Order of growth of ‘log n!’ and ‘n log n’ is same for large values of n, i.e., Θ (log n!) = Θ(n log n). So time complexity of fun() is Θ(n log n). The expression Θ(log n!) = Θ(n log n) can be easily derived from following Stirling’s approximation (or Stirling’s formula). 

      log n! = n log n - n + O(log(n)) Please write comments if you find anything incorrect, or you want to share more information about the topic discussed above.
