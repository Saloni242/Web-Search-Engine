Examples: Input: N = 4 Output: 5 Explanation: Sum of all proper divisors of numbers: F(1) = 0 F(2) = 1 F(3) = 1 F(4) = 1 + 2 = 3 Total Sum = F(1) + F(2) + F(3) + F(4) = 0 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 5 Input: N = 5 Output: 6 Explanation: Sum of all proper divisors of numbers: F(1) = 0 F(2) = 1 F(3) = 1 F(4) = 1 + 2 = 3 F(5) = 1 Total Sum = F(1) + F(2) + F(3) + F(4) + F(5) = 0 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 1 = 6 Recommended: Please try your approach on {IDE} first, before moving on to the solution. Naive approach: The idea is to find the sum of proper divisors of each number in the range [1, N] individually, and then add them to find the required sum. Below is the implmentation of the above approach: C++ filter_none edit close play_arrow link brightness_4 code // C++ implemenation to find sum of all // proper divisor of number up to N #include <bits/stdc++.h> using namespace std; // Utility function to find sum of // all proper divisor of number up to N int properDivisorSum(int n) { int sum = 0; // Loop to iterate over all the // numbers from 1 to N for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) { // Find all divisors of // i and add them for (int j = 1; j * j <= i; ++j) { if (i % j == 0) { if (i / j == j) sum += j; else sum += j + i / j; } } // Subtracting 'i' so that the // number itself is not included sum = sum - i; } return sum; } // Driver Code int main() { int n = 4; cout << properDivisorSum(n) << endl; n = 5; cout << properDivisorSum(n) << endl; return 0; } chevron_right filter_none Output:

 Time complexity: O(N * √N) Auxiliary space: O(1) Efficient approach: Upon observing the pattern in the function, it can be seen that “For a given number N, every number ‘x’ in the range [1, N] occurs (N/x) number of times”. For example: Let N = 6 => G(N) = F(1) + F(2) + F(3) + F(4) + F(5) + F(6) x = 1 => 1 will occurs 6 times (in F(1), F(2), F(3), F(4), F(5) and F(6)) x = 2 => 2 will occurs 3 times (in F(2), F(4) and F(6)) x = 3 => 3 will occur 2 times (in F(3) and F(6)) x = 4 => 4 will occur 1 times (in F(4)) x = 5 => 5 will occur 1 times (in F(5)) x = 6 => 6 will occur 1 times (in F(6)) From above observation, it can easily be observed that number x occurs only in its multiple less than or equal to N. Therefore, we just need to find the count of such multiples, for each value of x in [1, N], and then multiply it with x. This value is then added to the final sum. Below is the implementation of the above approach: C++ filter_none edit close play_arrow link brightness_4 code // C++ implementation to find sum of all // proper divisor of numbers up to N #include <bits/stdc++.h> using namespace std; // Utility function to find sum of // all proper divisor of number up to N int properDivisorSum(int n) { int sum = 0; // Loop to find the proper // divisor of every number // from 1 to N for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) sum += (n / i) * i; return sum - n * (n + 1) / 2; } // Driver Code int main() { int n = 4; cout << properDivisorSum(n) << endl; n = 5; cout << properDivisorSum(n) << endl; return 0; } chevron_right filter_none Output:
