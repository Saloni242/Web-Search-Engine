It is basically a 128 bit address. In IPv6 adress, hexadecimal notation is preferred. There are total 8 fields in IPv6 hexadecimal notation and each field consists of 16 bits. Hence, total bits are 8 x 16 = 128 Rules for compression: There are basically three rules for compression: Rule-1: When only 0 (zero) is available in a field then it is removed from the IPv6 address notation. IPv6 = FE82:1234:0:1235:1416:1A12:1B12:1C1F

After compression,
IPv6 = FE82:1234::1235:1416:1A12:1B12:1C1F Rule-2: When continuous 0s (zeros) are available in IPv6 address notaion then all zeros are replaced by ::. IPv6 = FE82:0:0:0:0:1A12:1234:1A12

After compression,
IPv6 = FE82::1A12:1234:1A12 Rule-3: When zeros are present in discontinuous places then at only one junction, 0s (zeros) are replaced by ::. IPv6 = 2001:1234:0:0:1A12:0:0:1A13

After compression,
IPv6 = 2001:1234::1A12:0:0:1A13
          or
     = 2001:1234:0:0:1A12::1A13 Unspecified Address: When in hexadecimal notation of IPv6 all fields are 0. It is denoted by ::. :: = 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0 Loop Back Address: When in hexadecimal notation of IPv6 all fields are 0 except the last field and last field value is 1. It is denoted by ::1. ::1 = 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1 My Personal Notes arrow_drop_up Save Recommended Posts: Transition from IPv4 to IPv6 address Difference between Lossy Compression and Lossless Compression Difference Between Network Address Translation (NAT) and Port Address Translation (PAT) Differences between IPv4 and IPv6 Difference between MAC Address and IP Address Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) IPv6 Addressing Format and Conventions Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) Header PGP - Compression Data Compression With Arithmetic Coding LZW (Lempel–Ziv–Welch) Compression technique Shannon-Fano Algorithm for Data Compression Finding DBA from given IP address Concept Of Address Split in OS Network Address Translation (NAT) pp_pankaj Check out this Author's contributed articles.
