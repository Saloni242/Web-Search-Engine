(P) Service oriented computing                 (1) Interoperability
(Q) Heterogeneous communicating systems        (2) BPMN
(R) Information representation                 (3) Publish-find-bind

XML is used for information representation. Question 2 The following figure represents access graphs of two modules M1 and M2. The filled circles represent methods and the unfilled circles represent attributes. If method m is moved to module M2 keeping the attributes where they are, what can we say about the average cohesion and coupling between modules in the system of two modules? A There is no change. B Average cohesion goes up but coupling is reduced. C Average cohesion goes down and coupling also reduces. D Average cohesion and coupling increase.GATE CS 2013 Software Engineering Discuss it Question 2 Explanation: Answer is "No Change" Cohesion refers to the degree to which the elements of a module belong together. Coupling is the manner and degree of interdependence between software modules 
Coupling between M1 and M2 = (Number of external links) / 
                             (Number of modules) 
                           = 2/2
                           = 1

Cohesion of a module = (Number of internal links) / 
                       (Number of methods)
                   

Cohesion of M1 = 8/4 = 2
Cohesion of M2 = 6/3 = 2


After moving method m to M2, we get following


Coupling = 2/2 = 1
Cohesion of M1 = 6/3 = 2
Cohesion of M2 = 8/4 = 2 Question 3 A company needs to develop a strategy for software product development for which it has a choice of two programming languages L1 and L2. The number of lines of code (LOC) developed using L2 is estimated to be twice the LOC developed with Ll. The product will have to be maintained for five years. Various parameters for the company are given in the table below. Parameter Language L1 Language L2 Man years needed for development LOC/10000 LOC/10000 Development cost per man year Rs. 10,00,000 Rs. 7,50,000 Maintenance time 5 years 5 years Cost of maintenance per year Rs. 1,00,000 Rs. 50,000 Total cost of the project includes cost of development and maintenance. What is the LOC for L1 for which the cost of the project using L1 is equal to the cost of the project using L2? A 4000 B 5000 C 4333 D 4667GATE CS 2011 Software Engineering Discuss it Question 3 Explanation: Let LOC of L1=x, so LOC of L2=2x Now, (x/10000)*1000000 + 5*100000 = (2x/10000)*750000 + 5*50000 Solving for x, we get x =5000 Source: http://clweb.csa.iisc.ernet.in/rahulsharma/gate2011key.html Question 4 A company needs to develop digital signal processing software for one of its newest inventions. The software is expected to have 40000 lines of code. The company needs to determine the effort in person-months needed to develop this software using the basic COCOMO model. The multiplicative factor for this model is given as 2.8 for the software development on embedded systems, while the exponentiation factor is given as 1.20. What is the estimated effort in person-months? A 234.25 B 932.50 C 287.80 D 122.40GATE CS 2011 Software Engineering Discuss it Question 4 Explanation: In the Constructive Cost Model (COCOMO), following is formula for effort applied 
Effort Applied (E) = ab(KLOC)bb [ person-months ]
                   = 2.8 x(40)1.20 
                   = 2.8 x 83.65 
                   = 234.25 Question 5 Which one of the following is NOT desired in a good Software Requirement Specifications (SRS) document? A Functional Requirements B Non-Functional Requirements C Goals of Implementation D Algorithms for Software ImplementationGATE CS 2011 Software Engineering Discuss it Question 5 Explanation: The software requirements specification document is a requirements specification for a software system, is a complete description of the behavior of a system to be developed and may include a set of use cases that describe interactions the users will have with the software. In addition it also contains non-functional requirements. Non-functional requirements impose constraints on the design or implementation (such as performance engineering requirements, quality standards, or design constraints) (Source: Wiki) An SRS document should clearly document the following aspects of a system: Functional Requirements, Non-Functional Requirements and Goals of implementation (Source: Fundamentals of Software Engineering by Rajib Mall) Question 6 The following is the comment written for a C function.  
        /* This function computes the roots of a quadratic equation
           a.x^2 + b.x + c = . The function stores two real roots
           in *root1 and *root2 and returns the status of validity
           of roots. It handles four different kinds of cases.
           (i) When coefficient a is zero irrespective of discriminant
           (ii) When discreminant is positive
           (iii) When discriminant is zero
           (iv) When discriminant is negative.
           Only in case (ii) and (iii) the stored roots are valid.
           Otherwise 0 is stored in roots. The function returns
           0 when the roots are valid and -1 otherwise.
           The function also ensures root1 >= root2
              int get_QuadRoots( float a, float b, float c,
                 float *root1, float *root2);
        */ A software test engineer is assigned the job of doing black box testing. He comes up with the following test cases, many of which are redundant. Which one of the following option provide the set of non-redundant tests using equivalence class partitioning approach from input perspective for black box testing? A T1,T2,T3,T6 B T1,T3,T4,T5 C T2,T4,T5,T6 D T2,T3,T4,T5GATE CS 2011 Software Engineering Discuss it Question 6 Explanation: T2,T4,T5 and T6 belong to different classes. Hence it gives an optimal test suite. Question 7 The cyclomatic complexity of each of the modules A and B shown below is 10. What is the cyclomatic complexity of the sequential integration shown on the right hand side? A 19 B 21 C 20 D 10GATE CS 2010 Software Engineering Discuss it Question 7 Explanation: 
Cyclomatic Complexity of module = Number of decision points + 1

Number of decision points in A = 10 - 1 = 9
Number of decision points in B = 10 - 1 = 9
Cyclomatic Complexity of the integration = Number of decision points + 1
                                         = (9 + 9) + 1
                                         = 19
