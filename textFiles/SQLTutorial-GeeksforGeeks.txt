As the name suggests, it is used when we have structured data (in the form of tables). All databases that are not relational (or do not use fixed structure tables to store data) and therefore do not use SQL, are called NoSQL databases.

As the name suggests, it is used when we have structured data (in the form of tables). All databases that are not relational (or do not use fixed structure tables to store data) and therefore do not use SQL, are called NoSQL databases.

As the name suggests, it is used when we have structured data (in the form of tables). All databases that are not relational (or do not use fixed structure tables to store data) and therefore do not use SQL, are called NoSQL databases.

As the name suggests, it is used when we have structured data (in the form of tables). All databases that are not relational (or do not use fixed structure tables to store data) and therefore do not use SQL, are called NoSQL databases.

As the name suggests, it is used when we have structured data (in the form of tables). All databases that are not relational (or do not use fixed structure tables to store data) and therefore do not use SQL, are called NoSQL databases.
