Examples: Input: N = 3 Output: 1, 8, 27 Explanation: Product of the output numbers = 1 * 8 * 27 = 216, which is the perfect cube of 6 (63 = 216) Input: N = 2 Output: 1 8 Explanation: Product of the output numbers = 1 * 8 = 8, which is the perfect cube of 2 (23 = 8) Recommended: Please try your approach on {IDE} first, before moving on to the solution. Approach: The solution is based on the fact that The product of the first ‘N’ Perfect Cube numbers is always a Perfect Cube. So, the Perfect Cube of first N natural numbers will be printed as the output. For example: 
For N = 1 => [1]
    Product is 1
    and cube root of 1 is also 1

For N = 2 => [1, 8]
    Product is 8
    and cube root of 8 is 2

For N = 3 => [1, 8, 27]
    Product is 216
    and cube root of 216 is 6

and so on
 Below is the implementation of the above approach: C++ filter_none edit close play_arrow link brightness_4 code // C++ program to find N numbers such that // their product is a perfect cube #include <bits/stdc++.h> using namespace std; // Function to find the N numbers such //that their product is a perfect cube void findNumbers(int N) { int i = 1; // Loop to traverse each //number from 1 to N while (i <= N) { // Print the cube of i //as the ith term of the output cout << (i * i * i) << " "; i++; } } // Driver Code int main() { int N = 4; // Function Call findNumbers(N); } chevron_right filter_none Output: 
1 8 27 64
 Performance Analysis: Time Complexity: As in the above approach, we are finding the Perfect Cube of N numbers, therefore it will take O(N) time. Auxillary Space Complexity: As in the above approach, there are no extra space used; therefore the Auxillary Space complexity will be O(1).
