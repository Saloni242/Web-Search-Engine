If there exists no such pair, then print -1. Examples: Input: S = 5, P = 6 Output: 2, 3 Explanation: Sum = 2 + 3 = 5, and Product = 2 * 3 = 6 Input: S = 5, P = 9 Output: -1 Explanation: No such pair exists Approach: Let the pair be (x, y). Therefore, according to the problem, the given sum (S) will be (x + y) and the given product (P) will be (x * y) 
If the pair is (x, y)

Given that product
    P = x * y
    y = P / x;  (eq.. 1)

Given that sum 
    S = x + y
    S = x + (P / x)  from (eq..1)
    x2 - Sx + P = 0

which is a quadratic equation in x.
 Since this is a quadratic equation, we just need to find it’s roots, using the below equation. 
Here:
  a = 1
  b = -S
  c = P
 Therefore the above equation will be changed as: Below is the implementation of the above approach: filter_none edit close play_arrow link brightness_4 code // CPP program to find any pair // which has sum S and product P. #include <bits/stdc++.h> using namespace std; // Prints roots of quadratic equation // ax*2 + bx + c = 0 void findRoots(int b, int c) { int a = 1; int d = b * b - 4 * a * c; // calculating the sq root value // for b * b - 4 * a * c double sqrt_val = sqrt(abs(d)); if (d > 0) { double x = -b + sqrt_val; double y = -b - sqrt_val; // Finding the roots int root1 = (x) / (2 * a); int root2 = (y) / (2 * a); // Check if the roots // are valid or not if (root1 + root2 == -1 * b && root1 * root2 == c) cout << root1 << ", " << root2; else cout << -1; } else if (d == 0) { // Finding the roots int root = -b / (2 * a); // Check if the roots // are valid or not if (root + root == -1 * b && root * root == c) cout << root << ", " << root; else cout << -1; } // when d < 0 else { // No such pair exists in this case cout << -1; } cout << endl; } // Driver code int main() { int S = 5, P = 6; findRoots(-S, P); S = 5, P = 9; findRoots(-S, P); return 0; } chevron_right filter_none Output: 
3, 2
