If there are no same elements in the array initially, then print the output as -1. Examples: Input: arr = {1, 1, 2, 4, 7, 8} Output: 16 Explanation: Repitition 1: Combine 1s from the array and insert the sum 2 in it. Updated Array = {2, 2, 4, 7, 8} Repitition 2: Combine 2s from the array and insert the sum 4 in it. Updated Array = {4, 4, 7, 8} Repitition 3: Combine 4s from the array and insert the sum 8 in it. Updated Array = {8, 7, 8} Repitition 4: Combine 8s from the array and insert the sum 16 in it. Updated Array = {7, 16} Largest sum = 16 Input: arr = {1, 2, 3} Output: -1 Explanation: There are no duplicate elements in the array initially. Hence no combination can be performed. Recommended: Please try your approach on {IDE} first, before moving on to the solution. Approach: This problem can be solved using the frequency of elements in the given array. Find and store the frequencies of each element of the given array in a map. Upon traversing the frequency map for each distinct element, if there is any duplicate element K in the map with a frequency more than 1, then increase the frequency of element 2*K by half the frequency of the K element. Finally, find the maximum number from the map. Below is the implementation of the above approach: filter_none edit close play_arrow link brightness_4 code // C++ implementation of the above approach #include <bits/stdc++.h> using namespace std; // Function to return the largest sum int largest_sum(int arr[], int n) { // Variable to store the largest sum int maximum = -1; // Map to store the frequencies // of each element map<int, int> m; // Store the Frequencies for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) { m[arr[i]]++; } // Loop to combine duplicate elements // and update the sum in the map for (auto j : m) { // If j is a duplicate element if (j.second > 1) { // Update the frequency of 2*j m[2 * j.first] = m[2 * j.first] + j.second / 2; // If the new sum is greater than // maximum value, Update the maximum if (2 * j.first > maximum) maximum = 2 * j.first; } } // Returns the largest sum return maximum; } // Driver Code int main() { int arr[] = { 1, 1, 2, 4, 7, 8 }; int n = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]); // Function Calling cout << largest_sum(arr, n); return 0; } chevron_right filter_none Output: 
16
