There were three rounds in the complete recruitment process which are mentioned below. Round 1: (Online Coding Round) The first round was an online coding contest consisting of six coding questions that were based on competitive programming. The total time given for this Coding Assessment was 6 hours. And that coding test was proctored by webcam. To clear this round I think at least one question is compulsory to complete with all test cases. I had done two questions because the difficulty level of those questions was difficult. This round is must to clear for appearing in the interview process. In this round, they actually want to check the Logical Ability of the candidates appearing for the interview process. The questions that were asked during the coding contest have different difficulty levels like few are intermediate and few are advanced but the overall level was difficult. The questions asked in this round are based upon different concepts of Mathematics entitled Roman Iterations, Salary Paid and based on the series and some manipulations entitled Marathon Winner and so on. In August starting, I received an email from TCS that I am shortlisted for the Interview Process. Round 2: (Technical & Managerial Interview) This the first round of the interview process where I interviewed both the Technical and Managerial interviewer simultaneously. This round began with little about myself. Then there was a brief discussion about my strengths and weaknesses. After that, they asked me about my role in internships that are mentioned in my resume. Then they discuss the details of projects done by me during my internship phase. So be prepare yourself according to your resume so that you can easily answer their questions. Now after 5-10 minutes of discussion on my resume, they start asking me the technical questions related to Data Structures such as the difference between Selection and Bubble Sort in terms of their working as well as their complexities. After this, the remaining technical sets of questions are from Java and 1-2 questions are from a Scripting language. The list of questions asked are mentioned below: Difference between Function Overloading and Function Overriding in Java. Interface and Abstract Class in Java. Why we use Interface if we already have abstract classes in Java? Abstraction and Encapsulation difference. OOPs Concepts. What is the use of NodeJS? callback() function in JS. Whether Python is a scripting language or not? Difference between Python and Javascript. Difference between HTML and HTML5 How migrations work and use in PHP? Promises in Javascript. Collection framework in Java. Types of Classes in Java. Adapter Class in Java. Use of static keyword in Java. Different domains and technology on which TCS is working. That’ all about the discussion in the Interview round. This round is about 30-45 minutes long. After this round, they asked to wait outside for further round. Round 3: (HR Round) This is the last round of the process. In this round, I was interviewed with the HR person of the company and this round was about 10-15 minutes long. They asked me about the different kind of questions related to TCS which are mentioned below: Who is the CEO of TCS? What is the Vision of TCS? What is the Mission of TCS? What are the Core Values of TCS? What is Industry 4.0? What is Business 4.0? What are the four pillars of Business 4.0? Why do you want to join TCS? Is relocation is acceptable to you? Whether do you have any problem with the bond or not? What attracts you towards TCS? HR may ask questions about the recent technologies as well as about the market trend. So prepare yourself accordingly. It was a mass recruitment drive. So my advice is to keep calm and have a smile on your face. And for the interview process, prepare the basic questions from your technical subject such as Data Structures, DBMS, Algorithms and have good hands-on any one of your preferred coding languages. My one more advice is to maintain eye contact with the interviewer and don’t hesitate and be confident to answer any question. The last and important thing if you are interested in the Digital profile of TCS, then you should have basic knowledge of Machine Learning, Blockchain, Cloud Computing, and Agile Methodology and must have advance knowledge in at least one of them. That’ all about my Interview experience of TCS. Good Luck!!

There were three rounds in the complete recruitment process which are mentioned below. Round 1: (Online Coding Round) The first round was an online coding contest consisting of six coding questions that were based on competitive programming. The total time given for this Coding Assessment was 6 hours. And that coding test was proctored by webcam. To clear this round I think at least one question is compulsory to complete with all test cases. I had done two questions because the difficulty level of those questions was difficult. This round is must to clear for appearing in the interview process. In this round, they actually want to check the Logical Ability of the candidates appearing for the interview process. The questions that were asked during the coding contest have different difficulty levels like few are intermediate and few are advanced but the overall level was difficult. The questions asked in this round are based upon different concepts of Mathematics entitled Roman Iterations, Salary Paid and based on the series and some manipulations entitled Marathon Winner and so on. In August starting, I received an email from TCS that I am shortlisted for the Interview Process. Round 2: (Technical & Managerial Interview) This the first round of the interview process where I interviewed both the Technical and Managerial interviewer simultaneously. This round began with little about myself. Then there was a brief discussion about my strengths and weaknesses. After that, they asked me about my role in internships that are mentioned in my resume. Then they discuss the details of projects done by me during my internship phase. So be prepare yourself according to your resume so that you can easily answer their questions. Now after 5-10 minutes of discussion on my resume, they start asking me the technical questions related to Data Structures such as the difference between Selection and Bubble Sort in terms of their working as well as their complexities. After this, the remaining technical sets of questions are from Java and 1-2 questions are from a Scripting language. The list of questions asked are mentioned below: Difference between Function Overloading and Function Overriding in Java. Interface and Abstract Class in Java. Why we use Interface if we already have abstract classes in Java? Abstraction and Encapsulation difference. OOPs Concepts. What is the use of NodeJS? callback() function in JS. Whether Python is a scripting language or not? Difference between Python and Javascript. Difference between HTML and HTML5 How migrations work and use in PHP? Promises in Javascript. Collection framework in Java. Types of Classes in Java. Adapter Class in Java. Use of static keyword in Java. Different domains and technology on which TCS is working. That’ all about the discussion in the Interview round. This round is about 30-45 minutes long. After this round, they asked to wait outside for further round. Round 3: (HR Round) This is the last round of the process. In this round, I was interviewed with the HR person of the company and this round was about 10-15 minutes long. They asked me about the different kind of questions related to TCS which are mentioned below: Who is the CEO of TCS? What is the Vision of TCS? What is the Mission of TCS? What are the Core Values of TCS? What is Industry 4.0? What is Business 4.0? What are the four pillars of Business 4.0? Why do you want to join TCS? Is relocation is acceptable to you? Whether do you have any problem with the bond or not? What attracts you towards TCS? HR may ask questions about the recent technologies as well as about the market trend. So prepare yourself accordingly. It was a mass recruitment drive. So my advice is to keep calm and have a smile on your face. And for the interview process, prepare the basic questions from your technical subject such as Data Structures, DBMS, Algorithms and have good hands-on any one of your preferred coding languages. My one more advice is to maintain eye contact with the interviewer and don’t hesitate and be confident to answer any question. The last and important thing if you are interested in the Digital profile of TCS, then you should have basic knowledge of Machine Learning, Blockchain, Cloud Computing, and Agile Methodology and must have advance knowledge in at least one of them.
