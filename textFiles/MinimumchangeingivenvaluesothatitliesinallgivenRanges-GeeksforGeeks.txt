Here a range consists of two integer [start, end] and D is said to be inside of range, if start ≤ D ≤ end. Examples: Input: N = 3, D = 3 arr[] = {{0, 7}, {2, 14}, {4, 6}} Output: 1 Explanation: Here if we increment D by 1 then it will be inside of every range that is start ≤ D ≤ end. Input: N = 2, D = 2 arr[] = {{1, 2}, {3, 2}} Output: 0 Explanation: Here D = 2 which is already inside of every range that is start ≤ D ≤ end. Recommended: Please try your approach on {IDE} first, before moving on to the solution. Appproach: Iterate over the array of ranges and to find the maximum value of the start[i] and the minimum value of the end[i] where the final max_start and min_end will show the common range of the given array of ranges. Check that D is already inside of the max_start and the min_end computed. If D is already inside of the range, then the minimum difference is 0. Else find the nearest value to D out of max_start and min_end that is min(abs(D - max_start), abs(D - min_end)) Below is the code of the above approach: C++ filter_none edit close play_arrow link brightness_4 code // C++ implementation find the minimum // difference in the number D such that // D is inside of every range #include <bits/stdc++.h> using namespace std; // Function to find the minimum // difference in the number D such that // D is inside of every range void findMinimumOperation(int n, int d, int arrays[3][2]){ int cnt = 0; int first = INT_MIN, end = INT_MAX; // Loop to find the common range out // of the given array of ranges. while (n--) { // Storing the start and end index int arr[2] = { arrays[cnt][0], arrays[cnt][1] }; // Sorting the range sort(arr, arr + 2); // Finding the maximum starting // value of common segment first = max(first, arr[0]); // Finding the minimum ending // value of common segment end = min(end, arr[1]); cnt++; } // If there is no common segment if (first > end) cout << "-1"; else { // If the given number is between // the computed common range. if (d >= first && d <= end) { cout << "0"; } // Finding the minimum distance else cout << min(abs(first - d), abs(d - end)); } } // Driver Code int main() { int n = 3, d = 3; // Given array of ranges int arrays[3][2] = { { 0, 7 }, { 2, 14 }, { 4, 6 } }; findMinimumOperation(n, d, arrays); } chevron_right filter_none Output:
